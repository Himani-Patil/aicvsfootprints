    <p>
        AICVS hosted its Webinar Series AICVS 2.0 with the second session on 21th March 2021 on ‘Off campus Placements’ , conducted by Affan Shaikh. He completed his undergraduate degree from VIT Pune and received an off campus placement at Credit Suisse, where he now works as a technology analyst. In this session, Affan gave an insight to off campus placements, internships, job opportunities and his journey of grabbing a job.
    </p>

<b>Resume</b>
<p>
The first important step in an off campus placement process is Resume. Every job description has a basic job qualification section, where they mention their requirements such as third year student, final year student etc. and your eligibility has to reflect in your resume, by mentioning your year of graduation. You can add your linkedin profile, github repo, objectives, education, internship experience(corporate). Add projects that you have done, which should ideally be covering a variety of techstack, and which shows you as a developer. One must also add curriculars, extra- curriculars and important achievements that make you stand-out. Extra curriculars may include managing a club, conducting a conference etc.

</p>

<p>
Affan points out that you should be able to measure your work, for instance you can mention the impact your project has created or how many people are using your work and highlight these measurements. Resumes can be written using Latex. Overleaf.com provides good templates for the same. The first stage in a placement process is a screening round, which is done using resumes.
</p>

<b>The fundamentals of interview</b>

<p>
Your problem solving skills and ability to express your thought process to your interviewers is important. You should be able to explain the time complexity, space complexity, the approach etc. To gain the problem solving ability one must do competitive coding and data structures & algorithms.
</p>

<p>
Other important aspects are aptitude, projects, core subjects ( Object Oriented Programming, Operating Systems, DBMS, Computer Networks).
</p>


<i>
Beginner Overview
</i>

<br>
<b>
Coding: Learning Phase.
</b>

<p>
You should be acquainted with both C++and Java, and master at least one of them.
</p>

<p>
Next, learn data structures. Create a list of all data structures you know, and analyse the topics you are lacking, and try to work on these. Recognise patterns in problems and relate it to concepts you know. After clearing the basics, move on to advanced data structures.
</p>
<u>
Key Points: Preparations-1
</u>
<p>
Affan suggests creating your own area for interview preparation where you can update your progress, store notes, important concepts etc. He also suggests using softwares like google docs for coding without auto-complete features, to help you to build your syntax. Try writing a clean code.

Create a list of questions which you found tough while practicing. Go through these tough questions and solutions before the interview. Also go through these problems every week till it builds the logic inside you. This helps overcome the fear of difficult problems.

Practice explaining the logic and concepts, by verbally speaking it out. Take many mocks and go through resume stories of different people. This helps in predicting the interview. Take a project, put it in a real life situation and try to predict the problems that can arise. Start criticizing your projects, the shortfalls and answer these questions. For instance, why this algorithm, why not that approach, why is the dataset small, why is your project not deployed etc.
</p>

<u>
Key Points: Preparations-2
</u>

<p>
Try to understand what a problem wants to teach you. Start solving medium and hard problems. At every point in your practice there should be something that is challenging.

In the interview, talk about other approaches to the problem asked to you. Which approaches will work, and which won’t.
</p>



<u>
The coding round:
</u>

<p>
After the screening round, the next stage is the coding round. Generally, 60-70 people are shortlisted out of 800 students. There are three types of coding rounds: only MCQs, only Coding or both. Keep a track of time while solving coding questions. Dont assume what the problem is. Check all the constraints first. Read the entire problem at least twice before you start coding.

For Oops, OS, DBMS, CN- begin your preparation with your original notes and then move on to other resources. Check the most asked questions on these topics. For aptitude, go through formulas from Cheat Sheets, R.S. Agarwal.
</p>

<p>
The virtual interview basics:

Affan suggests trying to look at the camera during the interview. Be habitual with using google docs for writing codes. Type while looking at the camera, and try to keep the interaction. Record the way you speak in front of the camera and analyse yourself.

Affan gave some useful tips for solving a competitive coding question in the interview:

Reiterate the question asked to you by the interviewer and tell him what you understood from it, to be on the same page. Specify to the interviewer the assumptions you consider on your own, such as if the input will be only positive numbers, or if size of array shouldnt be empty, time and space constraints if any etc. If your interpretation is wrong, the interviewer will correct you. While giving the solution, first specify the algorithm you will be using. If the interviewer agrees to the constraints, complexity etc only then move ahead and code the solution. Debug the code, have dry runs, find bugs, generate your test cases which wont work etc. Give a brute force as well as an optimised solution. After you give a solution, you can also suggest alternative techniques to solve the problem, such as using different data structures etc.

Modularization of code is important.

Write generic functions instead of writing different tasks in main. Divide your code into parts and make it reusable.
</p>

<u>
How to get unstuck?
</u>
<p>
If you get stuck while solving a problem, not down the steps that you are taking to come to the solution. Dry run edge cases, base cases to devise the initial algorithm. Use test cases that are going to fail the algorithm, and understand how to modify the algorithm.

Check the properties of data structures you are using and what fits for the solution.

Relate the question to any template or any standard questions you have solved. Affan suggests that based on the input size and total possible time complexity of the compiler, you can figure out if the subproblem is to be divided and what the problem actually wants you to solve. Repetition in dynamic programming can be done for further optimisations. He also suggests doing Reverse Engineering - take an output, figure out the range of input values possible and if they satisfy the constraints.
</p>

<u>
Tech stack vs Competitive coding
</u>

<p>
Tech/ Open Source work gets you an interview while fundamentals, OOPS, competitive coding help you crack the interview. Geeksforgeeks, leetcode are good sources to prepare for the interview. Affan does not advise to do courses explicitly for learning techstacks but to learn them based on how much is required for your projects. While building projects, build products.
</p>

<u>
Placements vs Internships
</u>

“It’s not about getting an opportunity, it’s about cracking the interview.”


An internship is nothing but an extended interview. You can apply for summer internships, semester internships or year long internships.He advises to not target direct placements by skipping internships. Check the PPO rate a company has, and start individual preparation for placements in case it’s low. Know what you wish to do long term, and make plans accordingly. It might differ if targeting for GATE, or masters, or govt jobs etc.

This information is available on whatsapp and telegram groups which you can find online. Check where the alumni of your college are working for guidance. You can also find recruiters on linkedin. Talk to recruiters of companies to understand the hiring processes and check if your profile is inline. Youtube is a great resource for finding opportunities. Search #hiring and #offcampus on linkedin to find openings. Have a strong student network. Rahul Sharma, Arsh Goyal, Gopinath S, Kushal Vijay have linkedin pages where they post updates every week. Linkedin is full of opportunities.

Work hard so that luck comes with you, don’t depend on luck!
