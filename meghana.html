        I vividly remember myself at the beginning of second year without any experience with python or how to use an IDE. I was anxious about git, and didn't know much about it. I did want to learn, but the question remained - how? Most of us have been at points where we want to learn something new and are just puzzled about where to start. With so many resources available, it's hard to decide how to spend our time. We can't even know what quality is if we don't know what is good and what isn't. For the most part, what I learned from that point onwards I have to give a huge credit to all the people who mentored me, because without them navigating this maze would have been impossible.


    </p>

    <p>
      
       After reflecting on my journey so far I think one of the things that has been really important is choosing an appropriate mentor. This has helped me to get where I wanted to go.


    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Finding a new direction</h3>
     At the start I figured it would be wise to experiment without any directions. But, after taking a bunch of courses in Machine Learning, It took me a while to figure out the best way to learn, but I finally realised that it's better not just to experiment on my own, but also to get advice from other professionals in the field. I believe the time I spent at ML meet-ups during that period helped. I was able to interact with people who were discussing their real, relevant problems and how they tried to tackle them. I was more aware of the applications ML can be applied to. When you're starting out, it's crucial to know what people are focusing on, or if there are any problems that this tool can help with. This will allow you to hone in on your skills and know how you want to specialize.

    </p> 
    Just around this time, I reached out to people in the meet-ups groups if they were looking for interns/would anyone be interested in taking me up as a mentee. I got an internship with Crysagi Systems, and honestly I cannot begin to describe how much I learnt through that experience. I learned how to use git and to wield its powers. I learned the basics of software development life cycles and how to debug code. After this point, I had been doing internships alongside college and kept a journal of everything new that I learnt. Maintaining a journal helped me get good feedback for myself based on the experiments I did.
</p>
    <p>
      
      <h3>Internship and its experiences</h3>
       I interned at Verloop in 2019 (at the end of my 6th semester) and during the time I developed an interest in Natural Language Processing.I loved the potential of gaining information from text and learning how to manipulate algorithms to understand languages. Verloop is a start-up in Bangalore focusing on conversational AI. I mostly worked on systems that detected the different entities in texts across languages. One of the important aspects I focused on at Verloop were low-resource languages and training models which perform well and provide low latency. I've had a lot of support here with a great bunch of mentors. That's really helped me to get on and do some good work - it's pushed me to speak at meet-ups and even encouraged me to focus more on research which lead to an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09820">ACL Publication about Hinglish Tweet sentiment analysis</a>. I believe the main thing was having someone with more faith in me than I had in myself. I loved being put out of my comfort zone and pushing myself to be the best version of myself.

        I believe the main thing was having someone with more faith in me than I had in myself. I loved being put out of my comfort zone and pushing myself to be the best version of myself. I later joined Verloop as an ML engineer and focused on learning more about the domain and how to create solutions in the problem space with keeping constraints in mind.

        I've been working for <a href="https://www.hunters.ai/">Hunters.ai</a>, an Israeli Cybersecurity Startup, for the past couple of months. Learning new things is an integral part of my work here. Machine Learning at hunters aims at enhancing the way we detect new leads for an attack; employing these algorithms to detect anomalies which 
        could be a sign of an attack.
        
    </p>
<h3>Knowledge is Power</h3>
    It would be naive to underestimate the power of luck & randomness in every field, but I also think that a need to constantly learn new things helped me a lot. I've been trying to get better by experimenting, trying new things and talking to people who have more experience. For me, one of the mental models I follow is understanding my <a href="https://fs.blog/circle-of-competence/">circle of competence</a>. 

            “When you're familiar with something and you’ll also know the limits of your knowledge.
If you want to improve your odds of success in life and business, then define the perimeter of your circle of competence, and operate inside. Over time, work to expand that circle but never fool yourself about where it stands today, and never be afraid to say “I don’t know.” 

When you reach these "I don't know"s interact with people who have deeper understanding of the subject and learn from them.
