    <p>
        AICVS 3.0 started with their series with a lot of insightful sessions focusing on experiences acquired by our talented speakers. For the second day of the session, we had Radhika Sethi. Her topic for the session was Opportunities in AI-Academia and Industry.
    </p>
      
    <h3>
     What is AI?
   </h3>   

    <p>  
        In this session, she started with a brief about what AI is all about. Understanding its clear meaning and its domain is important. Further, she covered about Applications of AI and how it can be useful in the present as well as the future. Further, a brief idea was given on how Instagram uses its AI. Because of this, Instagram has more engagement of users than before. She further added Instagram uses Word Embeddings. It is a process where it tracks what a particular likes videos, saves them, or ignores them. Accordingly, AI will give recommendations on top of that videos or images, or reels next time whenever a user is active.
    </p>    
    <h3>
      Domain 
    </h3>   
    <p>
        In this session, she talked about How can we choose a particular domain. She talked about a few points regarding it. First, it's all about trial and error. Second, we can be interested just more than one field. So it's the best way to explore as much as we can. Third, she added interest can be related to AI/ML too so first we should identify our interest in a particular domain.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Building up Skillset
    </h3>
    <p>
        In the next part, she talked about how can we build up our skills. She explained that we can start with courses on Coursera, Udemy, Youtube, and EdX. Doing Hands Projects is very important so we don't need to wait until our course ends. Also, AICVS conducts regular sessions, technical talks, and competitions. After building some projects add them on Github and also make a resume and CV highlighting your strengths.
